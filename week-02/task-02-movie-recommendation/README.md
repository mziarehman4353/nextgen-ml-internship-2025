\## Task 2 – Movie Recommendation using Clustering



\### 📄 Objective:

Use unsupervised learning to cluster similar movies based on genres and user ratings.



\### 📁 Dataset:

\- MovieLens 100k Dataset (or similar from Kaggle)(> ⚠️ Dataset not included due to file size limits.
> [Download rating.csv from MovieLens 100k](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)
)

\- Features used:

&nbsp; - Average Rating

&nbsp; - Number of Ratings

&nbsp; - One-Hot Encoded Genres



\### 🔧 Steps Followed:

1\. Loaded and cleaned the dataset

2\. Extracted features for clustering (ratings + genre encoding)

3\. Applied K-Means clustering to group movies

4\. Reduced dimensionality using PCA for visualization

5\. Interpreted clusters to identify similar movie groups (e.g., comedies, thrillers)



\### 📈 Outcome:

\- Grouped movies into meaningful clusters

\- Learned how clustering can support recommendation engines



\### 🛠️ Libraries Used:

\- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
